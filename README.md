# Bryant Avenue Sout Reconstruction

## Enhancements

- Reduce the volume and speed of traffic
- Reduce the width of streets and sidewalks
- Add a grassy strip of land between the street and the street (AKA a boulevard)
- Add pollinator-friendly planting to the "boulevard"
- Install attractive, low-wattage, low-lumen, lighting that doesn’t affect peoples ability to sleep and doesn’t add to light pollution
- Add a bicycle path
- Eliminate the “drag racing” layout in favor of a one-way, serpentine design (think Lombard Street in San Francisco)
- Add a cistern at every corner to filter and retain stormwater to help decrease the pollution of Lake Harriet
