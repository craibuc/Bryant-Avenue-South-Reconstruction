# Bryant Avenue South Reconstruction

Eliminate the “drag racing” layout in favor of a one-way, serpentine design (think Lombard Street in San Francisco).

The new street should:

- priorities the needs of the street's current residents over transient needs (e.g. transportation)
- reduce the volume and speed of traffic
- maximize asthetics
- minimize pollution

## Features

### One-way traffic, "serpentine" design

After more than 60 years of heavy, high-speed traffic, the residents of Bryant Avenue deserve a reprieve.  The new street should be one-way, with an inherent, speed-calming, serpentine design.

### Narrow street
Reduce the width of the street to help decrease the speed of traffic.  With a one-way follow, 50% of the road surface can used for improvements.

### Narrow sidewalks

The width of the sidewalks should comply with the requirements of the *current*, [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.ada.gov), rather than trying to anticipate what the law will be.  6' wide is good enough.

### Effective lighting
Install attractive, low-wattage, low-lumen, lighting that doesn’t affect peoples ability to sleep and doesn’t add to light pollution.  Ensure that the lighting __only__ illuminates the street--shields MUST be installed to prevent lighting from illuminating peoples' property.  

The frequency of lighting installations should be the same as the adjacent streets (Aldrich and Colfrax).

At each corner, use motion sensors to control the lighting.  Add a button, similar to what is used for crosswalks, to allow pedestrians to control the lighting.

### Boulevards
Add a vegetative strip of land between the street and the street (AKA a boulevard).  The boulevard should be planted with Minnesota-native, pollinator-friendly planting.

### Speed bumps

Speed bumps, two per block, should be added to each block of Bryant Avenue South.  

While the City of Minneapolis has said that speed bumps cannot be added to a bus line, one only needs to look at [Douglas Avenue](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffnt&q=douglas+avenue+minneapolis&ia=maps&iaxm=maps), which has speed bumps and [bus route #25](https://www.metrotransit.org/route/25):

### Bicycle path

Add a dedicate bicycle path so that individuals are not used as de facto, traffic calming measures.  __Do not use the UGLY, whilte, plastic pylons for this purpose.__

### Real-time monitoring

Install speed-monitoring sensors embedded in the pavement or in the lighting to allow for real-time monitoring of traffic volume and speed, with a publically-accessible website.  Capture photographs of drivers, including law-enforcement vehicles, exceeding two standard deviations of the speed limit and the mean velocity and post to website for additional analysis and public shaming.

### Stormwater cisterns

Add a [cistern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistern) at every corner to filter and retain stormwater to help decrease the pollution of Lake Harriet.
