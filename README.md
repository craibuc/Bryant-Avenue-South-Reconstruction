# Bryant Avenue Sout Reconstruction

Eliminate the “drag racing” layout in favor of a one-way, serpentine design (think Lombard Street in San Francisco).

## Features
- Reduce the volume and speed of traffic
- Reduce the width of streets and sidewalks
- Add a grassy strip of land between the street and the street (AKA a boulevard)
- Add pollinator-friendly planting to the "boulevard"
- Install attractive, low-wattage, low-lumen, lighting that doesn’t affect peoples ability to sleep and doesn’t add to light pollution
- Add a bicycle path
- Add a [cistern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistern) at every corner to filter and retain stormwater to help decrease the pollution of Lake Harriet 

## Topics

### Sidewalks

The width of the sidewalks should comply with the requirements of the *current*, [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.ada.gov), rather than trying to anticipate what the law will be.

### Speed bumps

Speed bumps, two per block, should be added to each block of Bryant Avenue South.  

While the City of Minneapolis has said that speed bumps cannot be added to a bus line, one only needs to look at [Douglas Avenue](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffnt&q=douglas+avenue+minneapolis&ia=maps&iaxm=maps), which has speed bumps and [bus route #25](https://www.metrotransit.org/route/25):
